PoliceAPI.cz
====================================================================
Unofficial API to the official Czech police database of stolen vehicles

Czech police doesn't understand the concept of [open data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data#Open_data_in_government).
It is not offering an API to search and verify vehicle identificators anymore.
At the end of 2011, its official API was removed without replacement.
Thus, I decided to create an API based on the official [web search](http://aplikace.policie.cz/patrani-vozidla/default.aspx)
located on the Police of the Czech Republic website.
